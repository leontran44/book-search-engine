## Description

This is a full-stack MERN application that allows users to search for books using the **Google Books API**. Users can search for books by title, author, or keyword. The search results are displayed in a list of books with the book's title, author, and a brief description. Users can click on a book to view more details about the book, including the book's cover image, title, author, description, and a link to view the book on Google Books. Users can also save books to their reading list and view their reading list of saved books.
